# COVID Impact Time-Series Prediction

This project was completed by Alexandre Berkovic, Max Petruzzi, Sri Reddy, and Osho Yonzon -- four Master of Business Analytics candidates from MIT -- for the course 15.072: Advanced Analytics Edge with Dr. Bart Van Parys.  

The goal was to develop methods to make interpretable short- to medium-term predictions on U.S. COVID-19 deaths based on hospital data that is available on the nationwide level.  

The purpose of this was both to:  
1.) Quantify the impact of staffing shortages and overcapacity on past COVID outcomes  
2.) Provide a method for predicting future outcomes during global health crises so that staff and resources can be mobilized accordingly

For more information on our methods and findings, please see the article found in the repo entitled ARTICLE.pdf or the slide deck entitled SLIDES.pdf. Thanks!
